# Custom Network Layers

You may find these three repos [c2f](https://github.com/strawberryfg/c2f-3dhm-human-caffe), [intreg](https://github.com/strawberryfg/int-3dhuman-I1), [DeepModel](https://github.com/strawberryfg/DeepModel_hand) useful to have a sense of how custom layers are defined and deployed in the framework. This is *potentially more difficult* than PyTorch, Keras.
