# Experiments
```
To understand the code structure, generally you only have to follow the order of layers presented in the [code](https://github.com/strawberryfg/Senorita-HANDS19-Pose/tree/master/src/network_layers) page. By then you would get to grips with most of the critical layers used throughout the training.

The work-flow is described below.

- You are given a HDF5 file from which you extract the image index to be trained, the bounding box provided by the organizer, and the 3D ground truth in real-world coordinate.
