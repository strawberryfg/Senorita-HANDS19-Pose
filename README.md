# Senorita-HANDS19-Pose

## Introduction

This repo is our implementation for the [HANDS19 Challenge Task 1 - Depth-Based 3D Hand Pose Estimation](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20913#learn_the_details) entry.

## Environment
- Dell Alienware R4 Laptop w/ one 8GB Geforce GTX 1070.

For PyTorch users, it's quite easy to transform weights across DL frameworks. (e.g. [this repo](https://github.com/xxradon/PytorchToCaffe)) This project applies to both Ubuntu and Windows. Piece of cake!
